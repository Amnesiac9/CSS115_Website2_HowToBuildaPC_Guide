                    The first rover to successfully land on Mars and communicate back to earth was the Sojourner rover, which was launched on December 4, 1996 and landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. It was the first rover to land on Mars and was the first rover to be controlled remotely from Earth. It was also the first rover to take a selfie on Mars.

                <li>
                    Exploration is continued to this day by two other rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance. Curiosity was launched on November 26, 2011 and landed on Mars on August 6, 2012. It is still operational today. Perseverance was launched on July 30, 2020 and landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. It is also still operational today.

                    She knows how to sit, lay down, shake, <strong>wave</strong>, play dead, bow, spin, and stand. She is very good at listening and will do anything for a treat.

                    She can be protective and sometimes barks at people coming into our home, she might seem tough at first, but she could not hurt a fly. She is very sweet and loves to brush up and lean on you, so be careful and don't get nocked over!
