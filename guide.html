                <!-- PARTS --> 
                <li id="step-parts"><h4>Choose your parts</h4></li>
                <p>
                    The first step to building a PC is to put together a list of the parts you need.
                    This first step can be the most difficult, but there are many resources available to help! 
                    <br><br>
                    This guide will focus on the building aspect, since choosing parts could be a full guide on it's own, but we will share some resources here.
                    One of my favorite resources for choosing parts is <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker.com</a>.
                    <br><br> 
                    PCPartPicker is a great resource for choosing parts because it has a compatibility filter, so you can be sure that the parts you choose will work together.
                    <br><br>
                    A great place to start is their <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/">build guides</a>, these allow you to
                    take a look at up-to-date expert builds that fit your budget, and gives you a good baseline to start with and tweak from there.
                    <br><br>
                    If you need more inspiration, you can always check out the <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/">completed builds</a> section to see what other people have built, and you can filter based on your budget!

                <!-- MOTHERBOARD -->
                <li id="step-motherboard"><h4>Install the Motherboard</h4></li>
                <p>
                    To install the motherboard, the easiest method is to lay the case down.
                    This way you can place the motherboard in and screw it down without having to worry about it falling or moving.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Be sure to install the I/O shield before the motherboard!</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The I/O shield is the rectangular protective plate that clicks inside the back of the case to protect the IO ports on your motherboard.

                <p>
                    Installing the RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a simple process, don't be afraid! <br><br>
                    The most important thing to remember is to line up the notch on the RAM with the notch on the motherboard.
                    Once lined up, simply push down on the ram evenly until it clicks into place. Viol√†! You've installed your RAM!

                <p>
                    Installing the CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is a delicate process, but it's not as scary as it might seem.
                    <br><br>
                    The most important thing to remember is to line up the triangle on the CPU with the triangle on the motherboard.
                    Once lined up, simply set the CPU into place, then simply close the latch. It might feel like it needs a lot of pressure when closing the latch, that's normal!

                    <br><br>
                    Next, you'll want to install the CPU cooler. This is the part that keeps your CPU from overheating and throttling its power, and it's important to have one!
                    <br><br>
                    Some CPU Coolers come with thermal paste pre-applied, but if yours doesn't, you'll want to apply a small amount of thermal paste to the center of the CPU.
                    <br><br>
                    Slowly push the CPU cooler into place, and screw it down in an X pattern to ensure even pressure is applied.

                <!-- STORAGE -->
                <li id="step-storage"><h4>Install the Storage</h4></li>
                <p>
                    Installing the storage is a simple process, but it's important to know the difference between the two main different types of storage.
                    <br><br>
                    There are two main types of storage, Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs).
                    <br><br>
                    HDDs use a spinning disk to store data, and are much slower than SSDs, but they are much cheaper per gigabyte. 
                    They also tend to slow down with age, and require defragmentation to keep them running smoothly.
                    <br><br>
                    SSDs are much faster, and don't slow down with time, but they typically have a much lower storage capacity for the same price. The prices are always coming down, though!
                    Large SSD's have become very affordable in recent years. If your motherboard supports it, the fastest SSDs are NVMe SSDs, which plug directly into the motherboard via M.2 slots.
                    <br><br>
                    The best option is to have both, an SSD for your operating system and programs, and an HDD for your large files or general storage.
                    <br><br>
                    To install the storage, simply slide it into the drive bay, and screw it down. If you need a visual guide, a video to follow along with is listed below.

                <!-- PSU -->
                <li id="step-psu"><h4>Install the Power Supply</h4></li>
                <p>
                    Installing the power supply is a simple process. To start, we should mention the difference between the two different types of power supplies, modular and non-modular.
                    <br><br>
                    Modular power supplies have detachable cables, so you can only use the cables you need, and leave the rest out of the case.
                    This is great for cable management, but they tend to be more expensive.
                    <br><br>
                    Non-modular power supplies have all the cables attached, so you'll have to find a place to hide any cables in your case.
                    <br><br>
                    To install the power supply, simply slide it into power supply bay on your case, usually in the bottom back side, and screw it down.
                    Then, plug in the cables to the motherboard, CPU, and GPU, and any other components that need power.

                <li id="step-os"><h4>Install the OS & Programs</h4></li>
                <p>
                    Before installing anything, it's recommended you boot into the BIOS and ensure everything is working properly and your components are being detected.
                    <br><br>
                    To boot to the BIOS, turn the PC on and press the key listed on the screen to enter the BIOS. This is usually F2, F10, or Delete.
                    <br><br>
                    Once in the BIOS, you can check to make sure your CPU, RAM, and Storage are all being detected properly. 
                    <strong>If your RAM supports XMP</strong>, be sure to enable it here to increase your RAM speed to the number advertised.
                
                    <br><br>
                    For installing windows, you can create a bootable USB following <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d">this guide from Microsoft</a>.
                    Then plug in a USB drive with your operating system installer, and follow the on-screen instructions. 
                    Remember to install your OS on your SSD for optimal performance!
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    After that, it's all up to you on which programs you want to install! Grab your favorite web browser, games, or productivity software and enjoy!
